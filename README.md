# College 2nd Semester Lab Activities Journey ðŸš€

I assume you have seen my 1st Semester Repo (or nope). And now I am in a 2nd Semester so here are the Repo of my journey in Algorithm and Data Structure subject!

## About

This repository serves as a log of my progress during the 2nd Semester lab sessions in college. It includes codes, project files, reports, and other resources created as part of my learning. Whether you're here to see my progress, or borrow ideas, feel free to explore and learn from my journey! (Good luck learning though lol since I rarely put comments in those)

Some of the technologies and tools Iâ€™ve used in these labs include:

- Programming Languages: [As of right now, I'm using Java]
- Apps: [Visual Studio Code, Alacritty & Windows Terminal for terminal]

Thank you for checking out my work! I hope you can also learn from it! ðŸ˜Š
